Project Tracker
A project assistant that will allow creation of tasks that make up a project
loosely following the ideas of Agile software development methodology. I hope
to create a toolset that will help me understand where my time is spent so I
can better plan my work.

Some major features I would like to include are task management, progress
tracking, and estimate generation.

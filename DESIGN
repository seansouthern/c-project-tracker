DESIGN NOTES
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Currently, the app is separated into Core, GUI, and CLI sections.

The Core folder contains code that defines basic data structures and provides
functions for creation, update, and deletion.

The GUI folder will contain code written in a GUI toolkit, possibly Qt.

The CLI folder will contain code written using the Curses toolkit.

GUI & CLI
There should be menu options for creating and opening projects. Once one of
these options has been selected a project will come into focus and more
options will open up with that particular object as the context. Navigation
commands should be included to allow for easier switching between contexts.

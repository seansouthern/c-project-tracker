DESIGN NOTES
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Currently, the app is separated into a Core code section, a Test framework,
and space has been set aside for a CLI and GUI.

The Core folder contains code that defines basic data structures and provides
functions for creation, update, and deletion.

The Test folder contains a testing harness that reads and compiles C source
files put into the tests subfolder.

The GUI folder will contain code written in a GUI toolkit, possibly Qt.

The CLI folder will contain code written using the Curses toolkit.

GUI & CLI
There should be menu options for creating and opening projects. Once one of
these options has been selected a project will come into focus and more
options will open up with that particular object as the context. Navigation
commands should be included to allow for easier switching between contexts.
